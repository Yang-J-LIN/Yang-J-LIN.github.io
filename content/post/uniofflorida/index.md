This summer I am going to visit the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering at the University of Florida as a Student Intern in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering. I will collabrate with Dr. Dapeng Wu to do research on machine learning and computer vision.

Some cultural activities may be included. During the intern, visit to Universal Studios and Disneyland in Orlando will be also organized. I'm looking forward to a beautiful summer of Florida.

I believe I will have a wonderful summer at UF.
