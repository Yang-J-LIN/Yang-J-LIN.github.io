# Introduction
This is a list of resources dedicated to natural language processing. It is inspired by the repository [awesome-nlp](https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp) by keon in Github. And I give my own answer to "awesome-nlp". A bunch of papers, books, courses and other resources will be listed. And I will make my own summary and knowledge tree of this field, with relevant resources provided. What's more, some resources on linguistics and philosophy of language will also be included, from which I think researchers on NLP will benefit a lot.

This is on updating. I will gradually add more contents on it.
