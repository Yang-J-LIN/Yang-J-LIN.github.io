Natural language processing is highly related to theoretical linguistics. This review aims to provide an overview of state-of-the-arts in the field of NLP under the categories in linguistics, through which I want to point out the meanings of our work.

This work is always going to be continued, and I will update it with the expansion of my knowledge in this field. It may perform incomplete at start. I will try my best to complete it!

# Introduction
The fields that are generally considered the core of theoretical linguistics are **phonology**, **phonetics**, **morphology**, **syntax**, and **semantics**.

# Tasks of Natural Language Processing
## Phonology

## Phonetics

## Morphology

### Neural Networks for Morphology

(Minh-Thang Luong *et al*, 2013) employs recursive neural network(RNN) and neural language model(NLM) to construct word vectors for unseen complex words. Two models are proposed. One is called context-insensitive morphological RNN(cimRNN). Another is called context-sensitive morphological RNN(csmRNN).

## Semantics
