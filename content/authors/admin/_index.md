I am an undergraduate student at Department of Automation at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interests include bioinformatics, natural language processing, computer vision and machine learning. Now I am working as a student intern in Lab of Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am going to École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne and join Prof. [Patrick Barth](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/barth-lab/)'s lab as a PhD student in the fall.
